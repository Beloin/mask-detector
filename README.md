# Simple Mask Detection
A simple mask Detector using Python:
 - OpenCV
 - Keras/Tensorflow
 - Sklearn

My main helper was [this article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) and [Prajnasd's github](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/mask_classifier).

Another helper was the Face Recognition preprocessed [model](https://github.com/prajnasb/face_detector).
